It increases collagen production to give you firmer and more toned skin.<br\/>It possesses concentrations of antioxidants that reduce oxidative stress levels in the skin and neutralize harmful free radicals in the environment. Folic acid's properties also increase hydration by strengthening skin barrier function. That leads to improved moisture retention and alleviates skin dryness.<\/p>","html":"","subheading":""}}},"block_order":["90cc846c-d353-41b0-89e5-f2075b976894","4b69b101-bd6a-4b72-8b50-963a5047895d","4e0c0deb-2106-4028-918a-e283f4b732e6"],"settings":{"borderbottom":true,"underline":true,"maintitle":"Folic Acid","maincontent":"","button_text":"","button_link":"","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"340c6bd2-fd58-4fe6-a782-409175053148":{"type":"custom-html","settings":{"subheading":"","title":"","html":"","add_vertical_spacing":true,"background_type":"full_width","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}}},"order":["main","dc635d58-2436-44bd-9043-fb9cfd72abbe","cf2d2083-a475-417b-889b-d69101817744","90b990a5-de23-42cc-88b4-e0a19c8489ec","340c6bd2-fd58-4fe6-a782-409175053148"]}
