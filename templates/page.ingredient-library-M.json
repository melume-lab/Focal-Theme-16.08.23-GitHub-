It evens skin relief and smooths wrinkles from the inside by rebuilding the skin where needed.<br\/>Collagen I – constitutes the most abundant amount of collagen in the tissues (approx 30%) and overall in the dermis (80%). The collagen molecules auto-assemble one another to form the characteristic fibers of the tissues. Collagen I makes up the crosslinked structure that can resist the skin's various physical stresses.<br\/>Collagen III – known as the collagen of youth, collagen III is produced during the early phases of wound healing. It is thought to be partly responsible for skin smoothness.<br\/>Fibronectin – are multi-adhesive soluble proteins that help attach cells to the various types of collagen. They also have an essential function in cell migration and differentiation.<br\/>Hyaluronic Acid is a critical component responsible for water retention in the tissue and regulating cell proliferation and wound healing.<br\/>Collagen IV – is an anchorage protein (also a part of Laminin-5 – see below) found at the base of the membrane, at the interface of the extracellular matrix of the dermis, and the basal layer cells.<br\/>Laminin-5 – is an adhesive glycoprotein involved in the regeneration of the damaged dermis.<br\/>It is a high-tech component that profoundly reduces wrinkles by rebuilding the skin where it is most needed.<\/p>","html":"","subheading":""}}},"block_order":["a29f8acd-894f-42cf-ad0f-fd5b0fed2a55","d4272deb-e96b-4062-97b0-dbbbd7975c4f","5f401017-6412-4804-9e83-8a8bb20b6e09"],"settings":{"borderbottom":true,"underline":true,"maintitle":"Matrixyl Synthe 6","maincontent":"","button_text":"","button_link":"","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","text_color":"rgba(0,0,0,0)"}},"e053191d-d4b6-4f27-9c4b-a1cec79a40b3":{"type":"MS_text-carousel","blocks":{"b3df0f07-c6ce-4bc7-be3c-cc77cf34b10a":{"type":"item","settings":{"icontitle":"SOURCE","title":"","content":"<p>Synthetic<\/p>","html":"","subheading":""}},"e165b07b-dcb4-47ad-ae13-db60a00a379d":{"type":"item","settings":{"icontitle":"CATEGORY","title":"","content":"","html":"<span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">Synthetic<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"opacity: 0.4;\"> • Natural • Naturally-Derived • Biotechnological\/Fermentation •  Fermentation <\/span>","subheading":""}},"51996150-1c62-4ad7-b8e8-7663cfddea55":{"type":"item","settings":{"icontitle":"WHAT IT DOES","title":"","content":"<p>Sodium Hyaluronate Low Molekular 400-1000kDalton High Molecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid 1500-1800 kDalton: Strong hydrating and anti-aging properties: penetrates the skin easily on all deep and upper layers and helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
